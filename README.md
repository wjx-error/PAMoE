This repository provides the official implementations for 
CVPR 2025 paper ["Learning Heterogeneous Tissues with Mixture of Experts for Gigapixel Whole Slide Images"](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2025/papers/Wu_Learning_Heterogeneous_Tissues_with_Mixture_of_Experts_for_Gigapixel_Whole_CVPR_2025_paper.pdf).

Due to the rush of graduation, we haven't had enough time to organize all the code yet. 
For now, we provide the implementation of PAMoE and demo implementations for integrating into [TransMIL](https://github.com/szc19990412/TransMIL) and Transformer.

The PAMoE implementation is based on: [flaxformer](https://github.com/google/flaxformer/blob/main/flaxformer/architectures/moe/routing.py#L647-L717),
[swiss-ai](https://github.com/swiss-ai/MoE).
We would like to thank them for their contributions.

The complete code will be released soon.
